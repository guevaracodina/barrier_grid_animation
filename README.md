# Barrier-grid animation
Barrier-grid animation (a.k.a. picket-fence animation or
kinegram) is an animation effect created by moving a striped transparent
overlay across an interlaced image.

```
SYNTAX
[encodedAnimation, venetianBlindsPattern] = barrier_grid_animation...
(transparentColumnWidth, animationFolder)
INPUTS
[OPTIONAL INPUTS]
transparentColumnWidth    Integer to indicate the width of the
                          transparent columns (default: 4)
animationFolder           Folder where the individual frames are stored.
                          These should be black and white pictures, a number 
                          between 2 and 6 images works fine in most 
                          situations (default: current)
OUTPUTS
encodedAnimation          Image to be printed on white paper (2D matrix)
venetianBlindsPattern     Image to be printed on a transparent medium (2D matrix)

In the early 2,000’s, a version of Barrier Grid Animation called “Scanimation®” was popularized by Rufus Butler Seder in such children’s books as “GALLOP!” and “STAR WARS.
